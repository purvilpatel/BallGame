# Roll-A-Ball-Unity
Rall-A-Ball game, First attempt to Unity Game Development

In my first encounter with Unity Development, I created a simple rolling ball game. I learned  many of the principles of working with Game Objects, Components, Prefabs, Physics and Scripting.

Roll-A-Ball is a two player game, where each player controls its ball with keyboard. Following is the list of control:

|-----------------------------------------------|

|       | Player 1 Controls	| Player 2 Controls |

| Left	|         A         |    Left Arrow     |

| Right	|         D       	|    Right Arrow    |

| Up	  |         W        	|     Up Arrow      |

| Down	|         S        	|    Down Arrow     |

| Jump	|     Right Ctrl    |     Page Up       |
