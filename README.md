# Roll-A-Ball-Unity
Rall-A-Ball game, First attempt to Unity Game Development

In my first encounter with Unity Development, I created a simple rolling ball game. I learned  many of the principles of working with Game Objects, Components, Prefabs, Physics and Scripting.

Roll-A-Ball is a two player game, where each player controls its ball with keyboard. Following is the list of control:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center;" width="10px"></th>
<th style="text-align:center;" width="20px"><strong>Player 1 Controls</strong></th>
<th style="text-align:center;" width="20px"><strong>Player 2 Controls</strong></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="20px">Left</td>
<td width="20px">A</td>
<td width="20px">Left Arrow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Right</td>
<td>D</td>
<td>Right Arrow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Up</td>
<td>W</td>
<td>Up Arrow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Down</td>
<td>S</td>
<td>Down Arrow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jump</td>
<td>Right Ctrl</td>
<td>Page Up</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
